This is your new Play 2.1 application
=====================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.


javaSource and scalaSource are inputs to unmanagedSourceDirectories. 
By default, sbt includes src/main/scala and src/main/java in its list of unmanaged source directories. 
For Java-only projects, the unnecessary Scala directories can be ignored by modifying unmanagedSourceDirectories:
// Include only src/main/java in the compile configuration
unmanagedSourceDirectories in Compile <<= Seq(javaSource in Compile).join

// Include only src/test/java in the test configuration
unmanagedSourceDirectories in Test <<= Seq(javaSource in Test).join

Classpaths, sources, and resources are separated into two main categories: unmanaged and managed. 
Unmanaged files are manually created files that are outside of the control of the build. 
They are the inputs to the build. 
Managed files are under the control of the build. 
These include generated sources and resources as well as resolved and retrieved dependencies and compiled classes.

sourceGenerators in Compile <+= sourceManaged in Compile map { dir =>
  val file = dir / "demo" / "Test.scala"
  IO.write(file, """object Test extends App { println("Hi") }""")
  Seq(file)
}

set unmanagedSourceDirectories in Compile <+= baseDirectory( _ /"src"/"java" )
